# DSA - Data Structures and Algorithms

[![CI](https://github.com/michal-zygmunt/dsa/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/michal-zygmunt/dsa/actions/workflows/ci.yml) &nbsp; [![codecov](https://codecov.io/github/michal-zygmunt/dsa/graph/badge.svg?token=T26A93WPMR)](https://codecov.io/github/michal-zygmunt/dsa)

Educational project that aims to recreate selected data structures
and algorithms from C++ Standard Template Library as a means to better
understand STL internal logic, design choices, impact on performance
and usability.

It is desired to provide cross-platform, vendor-independent library
with documentation, unit tests and code coverage reports.

## Implemented Containers

### Sequence containers
- [Array](@ref dsa::Array)
- [ForwardList](@ref dsa::ForwardList)
- [List](@ref dsa::List)
- [Vector](@ref dsa::Vector)

### Container Adaptors
- [Stack](@ref dsa::Stack)
- [Queue](@ref dsa::Queue)
