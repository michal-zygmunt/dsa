# DSA - Data Structures and Algorithms

Educational project that aims to recreate selected data structures
and algorithms from C++ Standard Template Library as a means to better
understand STL internal logic, design choices, impact on performance
and usability.

It is desired to provide cross-platform, vendor-independent library
with documentation, unit tests and code coverage reports.

## Implemented Containers

### Sequence containers
- [ForwardList](@ref dsa::ForwardList)
- [List](@ref dsa::List)

### Container Adaptors
- [Stack](@ref dsa::Stack)
- [Queue](@ref dsa::Queue)
