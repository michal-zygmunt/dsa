Educational project that aims to recreate selected data structures
and algorithms from C++ Standard Template Library as a means to better
understand STL internal logic, design choices, impact on performance
and usability.

It is desired to provide cross-platform, vendor-independent library
with documentation, unit tests and code coverage reports.

## Implemented Containers
